# Pagination Implementation in Web Application

This project demonstrates how to implement pagination in a web application, providing an efficient way to manage large datasets by splitting them into smaller, navigable chunks. Pagination helps improve the user experience by preventing information overload and improving performance.

## Features

### 1. Pagination of Data Displayed on the Frontend
- The data is split into smaller, more manageable chunks, allowing users to view a portion of data at a time.
- The frontend dynamically loads the appropriate subset of data based on the current page.

### 2. Control Over the Number of Items Per Page
- Users can customize how many items are displayed on each page, offering flexibility in viewing data.
  
### 3. Navigational Buttons
- **Previous Button**: Allows the user to navigate to the previous page of data.
- **Next Button**: Allows the user to move forward to the next page of data.
  
### 4. Backend API Support for Pagination
- The backend supports paginated data fetching, ensuring that only a subset of data is returned per request, improving performance and responsiveness.
- Pagination parameters (e.g., page number and items per page) are passed to the backend to fetch the correct data subset.
